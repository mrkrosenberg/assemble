#### Project 2 - Full Stack Application ####

### Avengers Assemble

  ## Project Description
  
    # I set out to build a full-stack application that was simple to use and user-friendly. I chose the Marvel Comics API and had to supplement it with a Google Images API. I wanted to build an interface that was straight-forward and provided easy-to-interpret feedback. 
    
    # The application utlizes two API's to build custom teams of Marvel characters. Users will be able to sign in and create unique teams of superheroes. Each user's team will be displayed on their team page as slides/cards.

  ## Technologies Used
  
    # Passport for authentication/authorization
    
    # Mongo/Mongoose for database
    
    # Express and Node.js for the backend
    
    # Javascript, HTML, CSS for front end
    
    # Mocha/Chai for testing
    
  ## Roadblocks
  
    # Marvel API fell short of what I thought it would do
      # had to find another api to supplement Marvel
      # luckily Google images has a node module that makes it easy to search for images

  ## Stretch Goals / Clean up
  
    # Create a User Account Page to manage account details
    
    # Create user-specific teams
      # Add buttons to each slide that will allow users to delete/edit characters
    
    # Use SaSS to tighten up CSS and create templates that can be alternated between (login page)
    
    # Prevent duplicate database entries (for characters)
    
    # Add functionality to accomodate for variations in character names entered into search bar
    
    # Add middleware to check for credentials at each endpoint
